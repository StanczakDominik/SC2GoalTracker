# SC2GoalTracker
A light-weight, hands-free tool that gets data from SC2 replays.

Customization can be adjusted in the settings.SC2GT for now which can be opened using notepad
* main_race_only - [[True/False]] Only tracks replays of race specified in the "main_race" field

* player_id - ID of the player SC2 profile, which this program needs to work, see [How to get player_id](https://github.com/SC2GoalTracker/SC2GoalTracker/blob/master/README.md#How-to-get-player-id) below
* twitch_messages_on - [[True/False]] Random messages that apppear based on how well / badly the player is doing in their goal / in their winrates
* replay_folder - Path to the replay folder the player wants to be tracked, needs to have the double forward slash

* auto_anchor_left_right_offset - Amount of offset the window will start in [[can use to offset into another monitor if values are set high enough e.g. 1920 for a 1920x1080 monitor with auto_anchor_corner bottom right will anchor the program to the bottom right of the second monitor that is on the right of the first one]]
* auto_anchor_bottom_top_offset - Amount offset for the window's y axis. [[Defaults to adjust for Windows taskbar along the bottom]]

# Q&A
### This program's buggy as heck / I want to do X  
There's a lot of bugs at the moment, and customization is a little limited for the time being. Please check the [Issues tab](https://github.com/SC2GoalTracker/SC2GoalTracker/issues) to see what I'm aware of and what I would like to work on. Please add anything that I'm missing!  

### Multiple monitor support?  
Currently players will have to change the auto_anchor_left_right_offset /or auto_anchor_bottom_top_offset fields enough to make it place in another monitor
